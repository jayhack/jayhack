### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an AI enthusiast and entrepreneur based in SF. I've been doing AI product develpment and research for over 10 years, most recently at [AI startup](https://beautymatter.com/articles/femtec-health-acquires-mira-beauty-for-28-million) applying personalization to beauty shopping (Mira AI, Inc.).

A few things I've built:
- [GP-Tutor](https://www.loom.com/share/945d9fe0f65c440e900fbb1f0f2bef0a): an AI-powered interface that has conversations with you based on Quizlet flashcards
- [Shameo.tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue8N4ezBp_4&ab_channel=JayHack): Cameo for deepfakes - make celebrities say anything you want in videos
- [Autodoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRVXcqAfOY&ab_channel=JayHack): a GPT-3-powered plugin for text-to-code on docs pages
- [MIRA BEAUTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbgiF6vKwC8&ab_channel=JayHack): a personalized shopping platform for cosmetics
- [AR for Beauty Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LCRLtbHE_w&ab_channel=JayHack): a "smart mirror" for exploring makeup products and tutorials
- [CVChess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZOA1ew-zYc&ab_channel=JayHack): automatic tracking of chess moves via computer vision
